# \section{What causes what?}
# 1.Why can’t I just get data from a few different cities and 
# run the regression of “Crime” on “Police” to understand how more cops in the streets affect crime? (“Crime” refers to some measure of crime rate and “Police” measures the number of cops in a city.)

# What we want to know is the causal effect of police on crime rate. This is of
# great policy significance.

# It's possible that places with an inordinate amount of crime tend to employ a large police force.
# Which means crime rate is the causal effect of police.

# The result of such regression can not credibly identify a causal effect of police on crime.

# 2. How were the researchers from UPenn able to isolate this effect? 
# Briefly describe their approach and discuss their result in the “Table 2” below, from the researchers' paper.

# The terror alert level rose and fell four times, so we have events that turn on and off repeatedly—this is an important virtue in that it reduces the possibility of
# spurious correlation.

# Second, we use daily data, and the “treatment windows”—the time from the onset to the conclusion of the shocks—are short,
# a matter of days or weeks, thus reducing the possibility that our results are
# due to changes in other factors

# During a high-alert period, the D.C. police department increases the number of patrols, increases the length of shifts in order to put
# more police on the street, and activates a Joint Operations Command Center,

# We offer another test of the tourism thesis below
# when we examine what happens to the number of burglaries (a non-touristbased crime) during high-alert periods.

# during heightened alert periods, the police department switches from
# three 8-hour shifts a day to two 12-hour shifts, thus increasing the effective
# police presence by 50 percent

# difference-in-difference estimator controls for any factors such as weather,
# tourism, or other events that affect the districts similarly. Even after controlling for all such factors and recognizing that our assumption is too strong,
# we still find that crime decreases in District 1 during high-alert periods by
# some two crimes per day, or more than 12 percent.

# an elasticity of .3. The negative and statistically significant coefficient on
# burglaries is important because burglaries are not crimes against tourists. If
# the declines in crime that we find during high-alert periods were due to
# reductions in tourism rather than increases in police presence, we would not
# expect to see a decrease in burglaries.
